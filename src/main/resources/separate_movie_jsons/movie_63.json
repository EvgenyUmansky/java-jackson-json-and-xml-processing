But when Cole is mistakenly sent to 1990 instead of 1996, he's arrested and locked up in a mental hospital. There he meets psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly, and patient Jeffrey Goines, the son of a famous virus expert, who may hold the key to the mysterious rogue group, the Army of the 12 Monkeys, thought to be responsible for unleashing the killer disease.","popularity":21.821,"poster_path":"/2F9KcDGZbEdaQN5jV9ziyRZYY7u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/8lvHyhjr8oUKOOy2dKXoALWKdp0.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":507,"logo_path":"/z7H707qUWigbjHnJDMfj6QITEpb.png","name":"Atlas Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":17031,"logo_path":null,"name":"Classico","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-12-29","revenue":168840000,"runtime":129,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The future is history.","title":"Twelve Monkeys","video":false,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":5285}
